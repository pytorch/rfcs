# torchelastic soft restarts - Enabling training without restarting the world

This RFC proposes a new restart policy to the `torch.distributed.elastic` package.
We use `torch.distributed.run`, torchelastic and TE interchangeably in this document. 


## Background

Distributed training with pytorch usually consists of the following workflow (see diagram below):

1. Users use torch.distributed.run to start jobs on a single node.
2. They use the same command on N different machines.
3. The torch.distributed.run would start a TE agent that acts as a process manager. It starts and manages worker processes.
4. Worker processes use pytorch distributed to initialize process groups and execute training.

![Distributed training](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/_images/agent_diagram.jpg)

The current behavior for `torch.distributed` process groups is that it induces a failure on all workers in the job if
any worker fails.
In the case of `backend=nccl`, any worker failure causes other workers to get stuck in the CUDA kernel.
This is because nccl ops use spin locks on the device for optimization purposes.
To remedy this, there is a watchdog thread that raises a `TimeoutError` if CUDA ops get stuck.

Upon detecting a worker failure (PID no longer exists), the TE agents on each node will terminate
all surviving workers and re-spawn the workers in compliance to the user set min and max number of workers.
We call this global restart behavior as a hard restart.

## Motivation

While hard restarts make it possible for existing training scripts to be invoked with TE for fault tolerance,
it is not optimal for training scripts that (not an exhaustive nor mutually exclusive list):

1. have expensive initialization logic
2. those that cannot checkpoint often (for various reasons)
3. already internally withstand worker failures (e.g. parameter servers, readers)
4. can run to completion with surviving workers without replacement of failed workers

For these types of applications a soft restart policy is desired where on worker
failure surviving workers are not hard terminated and restarted by TE but rather
notified that a change-in-peers event has occurred with information
about the new RANK, WORLD_SIZE, MASTER_ADDR, and MASTER_PORT. The survivors use this information
to reinitialize in-process and continue making progress.

<em>Note that even in the presence of soft restarts,
DDP scripts that use torch.distributed process groups
with the nccl backend won’t be able to run to completion with partial failures.
This is because currently, a worker failure induces
an uncatchable failure (SIGABRT rather than an Exception) on other workers,
leaving no surviving workers behind.
We acknowledge this as a caveat and will address this in future releases of PyTorch.
The rest of this document assumes that induced exceptions on surviving workers are catch-able.</em>

## Description

We propose adding a soft restart policy to TE. Users can launch their scripts with soft restarts
enabled by passing the `--restart_policy=soft` parameter to `torch.distributed.run` as:

```
python -m torch.distributed.run \
    --restart_policy soft \
    --nnodes 2 \
    --nproc_per_node 4 \
    main.py
```

The command above, when run on two separate nodes, launches 2x4 copies of  `main.py`
with a soft restart policy. If a worker fails on node 1, then its local peers are force
terminated - but not restarted - and the workers on node 2 are notified on this event.
Since the new rank and world size information needs to be propagated to the
surviving workers on node 2, the application code needs to be changed to use the
included runtime API to receive this information. For instance for simple trainers,
the application’s code would look like the following pseudo-code (runtime API underlined):

```buildoutcfg
while local_attempts < maximum_attempts:
  try:
    dist.init_process_group(
        backend="nccl",
        **worker_info.get_pg_parameters(), # rank, world_size, master info
    )
    for epoch in range(state.epoch, state.total_epochs):
     for batch in dataloader:
       do_train(batch, state.model) # implemented by user
     state.epoch +=1

    if dist.get_rank() == 0
       maybe_save_checkpoint(state)
  except Exception e:
    log_failure(state, e)
    dist.destroy_process_group()
    worker_info = torch.distributed.elastic.get_worker_info()
    reset(worker_info) # implemented by user


```

This document describes addition of a soft restart policy that behaves according to the following table:

|          Scale up event      |  Scale down event |   Worker failure  |
|----------|:-------------:|------:|
| Hard Restart Policy |  Terminate workers, perform re-rendezvous | Terminate workers, perform re-rendezvous | Terminate workers, perform re-rendezvous |
| Soft restart Policy |    Broadcast PAUSE, start re-rendezvous, Broadcast WORK   |   Broadcast PAUSE, start re-rendezvous, Broadcast WORK | Terminate local workers, decrease max_restarts, proceed with scale-down event |


## Implementation Details

This section describes the internal workings of the proposed soft restarts presented
in the Description section.

### Torchelastic API changes

TE can be executed both programmatically and via command line.
In order to use a new policy via cmd, one should use a new `--restart_policy` flag, e.g.:

```
python -m torch.distributed.run \
    --restart_policy soft \
    --nnodes 2 \
    --nproc_per_node 4 \
    main.py
```

If the flag is omitted, the default policy will be executed.

`torch.distributed.launcher.api.LaunchConfig` will get a new parameter: RestartPolicy

```
# Note: The policy name most likely will be changed
class RestartPolicy:
  HARD
  SOFT

class LaunchConfig:
   ...
   restart_policy: RestartPolicy

# launching an agent with soft-restart policy
from torch.distributed.launcher import launch_agent, RestartPolicy, LaunchConfig

results = launch_agent(config=LaunchConfig(..., restart_policy=RestartPolicy.SOFT, ...)

```

### Worker(trainer) API changes

Trainer logic should be modified as well to use the soft restart policy.
When TE starts a group of processes, it populates their env. variables with necessary
information to set up the process group: WORLD_SIZE, RANK, MASTER_ADDR, MASTER_PORT.
There is no need for workers to communicate back to TE agent process.
This functionality needs to be changed, since env variables cannot be used anymore.

The following API will be introduced:

```python

# module: torch.distributed.elastic.runtime

@datalcass
class WorkerEvent:
 # timestamp when the event occurred
 timestamp: int
 worker_info: WorkerInfo
 worker_state: WorkerState
 change_event: Optional[WorldChangeEvent]

class WorldChangeEvent(Enum):
   """
   Enum representing the reason of the event. This information will be devided on worker
   process.
   """
   SCALE_UP,
   SCALE_DOWN

class WorkerState(Enum):
   """
   Enum representing the state of the worker that is advertised
   by the agent. It is up to the worker process to treat the
   state according to the its logic.
   """
   HEALTHY = "HEALTHY"
   PAUSED = "PAUSED"

@dataclass
class WorkerInfo:
 # worker rank across a single node.
 local_rank: int
 # worker rank across a single role
 role_rank: int
 # worker global rank across all workers and roles
 rank: int
 # number of workers managed by the TE agent
 local_world_size: int
 # number of workers participating in the current role
 role_world_size: int
 # global number of workers
 world_size: int
 # new master address and port that can be used to initiate a new process group
 master_addr: str
 master_port: int

def get_worker_event() -> WorkerEvent:
   """
   Returns the last event that is observed on the worker process.
   If there is no events observed, returns the latest recorded event.
   TE agent always sends initial event to the worker process, as a result
   worker process can use this method immediately.
   """
   pass

def get_worker_info() -> WorkerInfo:
   """
   Reads the last event that is observed on the worker process.
   Convenience method, see `get_worker_event` for more info.
   """
   pass

```

### Soft Restart Policy Description

To better understand how soft-restarts work, we split the soft restart behavior description
into the following parts:
1. scale up event
2. scale down event
3. worker failure event.

#### Scale down event

Scale down event occurs when one or more TE agents become unresponsive.
This may happen due to network issues, nodes finishing unexpectedly or agents getting terminated. The
surviving agents will follow the next protocol:

1. The surviving TE agents will detect that scale-down event occurred and execute a soft restart policy.
2. TE agents will broadcast a PAUSE message to the local workers and will start a new rendezvous round.
3. Existing TE agents will wait for new TE agents to join rendezvous.
4. If the total number of TE agents at the end of the wait period is between configured `min` and `max`, all TE agents will conclude that the rendezvous round is successful.
    1. If the total number of TE agents is not between `min` and `max`,  TE agents will start the rendezvous failure procedure. They will terminate existing workers and exit with rendezvous errors.
5. TE agents will update their worker infos and propagate the events to the worker processes.
6. Worker processes will read events and restart train loop.


#### Scale up event
The scale up event occurs when TE detects a new agent trying to join the cluster:

1. TE agents will stop the current rendezvous round without terminating workers.
2. The rendezvous algorithm will follow the scale down event.
3. It is important to mention that workers should periodically check the current status
 of the world and re-initialize if they detect a membership change event.

#### Worker failures

The worker failure is a special case of failure, where the worker process deliberately
fails with an Exception or Signal. The correct procedure may depend on the application type.
There are several possibilities:

1. `soft-no-replace` Terminate the existing workers on the local TE agent and decrease max_restarts.
When a single worker fails, the corresponding TE will terminate all its local workers.
If the amount of max_restarts is greater than 0, the TE agent will start a new rendezvous round.
This would be similar to a scale up event.

2. `soft-replace` Restart the surviving worker. In this case we need to maintain the max_restarts parameter per
worker process, which makes things very complex. The current use-cases do not need this level of granularity.

3. Record the failure, and wait while other workers finish. This is a true-soft restart use-case.
The issue is that it violates the current TE architecture: TE was designed to work with homogeneous
group nodes. By leaving existing workers alive we create a heterogeneous group, which will make
things hard to debug for the final user.


For this RFC we will consider #1 option: `soft-no-replace`. In future releases we will add the additional `soft-replace`
restart policy.

### Message passing protocol

It is assumed that there will be infrequent calls between the worker and the TE agent.
The size of the message between two processes will not be greater than 1 MiB.
This means that the requirements are pretty relaxed and almost any type of communication
pattern can suit the use-case. The message protocol consists of a message channel,
serialization formats and message objects. The message objects may be the same as in the API section above.

#### Serialization formats
Almost any format can suit the use-case, but the favorable candidate is json.

#### Message channel
Message channel serves as a communication layer between agent and worker.
It will be designed following the consumer-producer pattern,
where an agent is a producer and workers are the consumers of the events.

The communication layer may then be extended to allow workers to send messages to the agent.
The communication will be pull based. TE Agents will send events to the message channel if they observed
the world change event. Worker processes will consume the events in order and apply them to get the
latest state of the world.

There are several alternatives that can be used for communication backend:

1. multiprocessing.Queue
    1. This is in fact how torchelastic expiration timers are implemented (see [docs](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/elastic/timer.html)).
    2. Downside is that the trainer has to be launched with multiprocessing.spawn() and cannot be launched with subprocess.Popen().
2. torch.rpc
    1. Robust option, we can use torch.rpc under the hood to send and receive messages.
    2. We'd get bi-directional channel for free since rpc works for agent → trainer as well as trainer → agent.
    3. The downside is that it might be an overkill for what we want to do since torch.rpc was designed to actually send over tensors P2P
    4. Tt might be tricky to overlap trainer process_groups and agent<>trainer rpc groups
3. File based
    1. Robust choice for 90% of the use-cases. Idea is to create a directory per (agent, worker) channel and drop files with the serialized Msg on sends. A file watcher is used on the receiver-side. One can use the dir and file name + structure to organize the channel in a logical way.
    2. Posix filesystem semantics basically guarantee strong consistency - we do have to be careful of non-posix mounts (e.g. S3 FUSE). In most cases we can circumvent this by using a guaranteed on device volume like /tmp since we would only write triple digit kBs at most.


#### RestartPolicy interface

The core torchelastic agent logic will be modified.
TE core logic consists of the monitor loop that acts as a state machine.
The new `RestartPolicyStrategy` interface will be introduced.
The interface will aggregate a common logic for different policy algorithms.
The current hard restart algorithm will be moved to the `HardRestartPolicyStrategy` class.
The new `SoftRestartPolicyStrategy` will be implemented that will incorporate soft-restarts behavior.

The TE monitoring loop will be changed to detect both scale down and scale up events.
It currently detects scale-up events. This functionality would require careful testing,
making sure that rendezvous does not happen twice on a scale-down event: e.g. when a node
goes missing and node re-appears.


## Future Work: Modifying torch.distributed process groups

1. The follow up step will be to modify `torch.distributed`, process groups, specifically nccl` backend, to make sure that they work with the soft restart policy.
2. We will also implement additional variations of soft restart policy, as described in the `Worker failures` section.
