- Fork the rfcs repo: https://github.com/pytorch/rfcs
- Copy `RFC-0000-template.md` to `RFC-00xx-my-feature.md`, or write your own open-ended proposal. Put care into the details.
- Submit a pull request titled `RFC-00xx-my-feature`. 
    - Assign the `draft` label while composing the RFC. You may find it easier to use a WYSIWYG editor (like Google Docs) when working with a few close collaborators; feel free to use whatever platform you like. Ideally this document is publicly visible and is linked to from the PR.
    - When opening the RFC for general discussion, copy your document into the `RFC-00xx-my-feature.md` file on the PR and assign the `commenting` label.
- Build consensus for your proposal, integrate feedback and revise it as needed, and summarize the outcome of the discussion via a [resolution template](https://github.com/pytorch/rfcs/blob/master/RFC-0000-template.md#resolution).
    - If the RFC is idle here (no activity for 2 weeks), assign the label `stalled` to the PR.
- Once the discussion has settled, assign a new label based on the level of support:
    - `accepted` if a decision has been made in the RFC
    - `draft` if the author needs to rework the RFC’s proposal
    - `shelved` if there are no plans to move ahead with the current RFC’s proposal. We want neither to think about evaluating the proposal
nor about implementing the described feature until some time in the future.
- A state of `accepted` means that the core team has agreed in principle to the proposal, and it is ready for implementation. 
- The author (or any interested developer) should next open a tracking issue on Github corresponding to the RFC.
    - This tracking issue should contain the implementation next steps. Link to this tracking issue on the RFC (in the Resolution > Next Steps section)
- Once all relevant PRs are merged, the RFC’s status label can be finally updated to `closed`.

# Pytorch-DataLoader-Economic

## **Summary**
A new PyTorch dataloader multiprocessing pipeline design is suggested. This pipeline splits the task of batch generation, into 2 types of workers:\
item generating workers (by calling `dataset.__getitem__`), and batch generating workers (by calling `collate_fn`).  
This pipeline is designated to significantly reduce random-access-memory (RAM) usage, without any significant reduction in throughput (TPT).

## **Motivation**
In serveral applications, the input batch of a PyTorch model may require large amounts of RAM. Such applications may include video processing, 3D graphics, etc. 

By current dataloader multiprocessing pipeline design, workers simultaneously prepare batches and send them into shared memory, by a queue.
In practice, about _num_workers_ prepared batches are simultaneously stored in shared memory, nearly after epoch start. 
At most, _num_workers_ * _prefetch_factor_ may be simultaneously stored in shared memory.
The main process operates in parallel to the workers, to extract one batch after another, from shared memory, and inject it into the model for training/validation/test. 

Simultaneously storing about _num_workers_ batches in shared memory, imposes a limit over _num_workers_:\
_num_workers_ < _total_available_ram_in_bytes_ / _batch_size_in_bytes_.\
This limitation can produce a bottleneck over training TPT, not allowing to increase num_workers, due to server's RAM limitations.
Alternatively, to increase num_workers, a sever with more available RAM is required, increasing sever cost.

A new dataloader multiprocessing pipeline is suggested. In this pipeline, there are two types of workers:
item generating workers (by `dataset.__getitem__` function), and batch generating workers (by `collate_fn`). 
This design allows to simultaneously process only up to _prefetch_factor_ batches by all the workers together.
The decoupling of number of processed batches from _num_workers_, allows to increase _num_workers_, without any significant increase in shared memory consumption.
As in current implementation, the workers continuously generate items during epoch, and are not expected to enter idle state. Hence no TPT reduction is expected. 

Another smaller advantage is that in the proposed implementation, the first batch in each epoch is generated by multiple workers, while in current implementation it is generated by a single worker.
Hence, using the suggested implementation, epoch can potentially start faster. 

The new flow is introducing only minor modifications in dataloader interface, making the transition almost transparent to the user.

### **High Level Description**

By the current multiprocessing pipeline, a single level of workers is used. 
The main process sends _prefetch_factor_ batches to each worker.
Each worker prepares one batch at a time, and sends it back to the main process by worker_result_queue.
After a batch is retrieved by the main process, another batch is sent to the appropriate worker.

In the suggested pipeline, there are 2 levels of workers: 
* item_workers - designated to generate one item at a time (by running `dataset.__getitem__` function), and send it to shared memory 
  * This worker is similar to the workers of the current design, but it receives and sends one item at a time (and not one batch at a time) 
* batch_workers - designated to get items from shared memory, collect _batch_size_ items, run collate function, and send the prepared batch back to shared memory, for consumption by the main process

Current design dataflow: main_process -> workers -> main_process

Suggested design dataflow: main_process -> item_workers -> batch_workers -> main_process

### **Main Process**
* Retrieve and store prepared batches from batch_workers (by worker_result_queue)
  * Track number of items at work (workload) by each worker. Make sure to reduce workload counter for the relevant batch_worker, and for each of the relevant item-workers, when retrieving the batch 
* Send batches of items to item_workers, one batch at a time
  * A possibly different iw_idx should be assigned to each item
    * Select iw_idx of the items_worker with the minimal workload
  * An identical bw_idx should be assigned to all items in the same batch
    * Select bw_idx of the batches_worker with the minimal workload
  * Make sure that the sum of item_workers workload is always <= _prefetch_factor_ * _batch_size_. Stop sending batches when reaching this limit. 
  * Make sure to increase workload counter for the relevant batch_worker, and for each of the relevant item-workers, when sending the batch of items
  * Each item should include the following data: (item_idx_in_batch, batch_idx, item_index, iw_idx, bw_idx, batch_size):
* Once the next required batch is retrieved, return batch to caller function

### **Item Worker**
* get item from index_queue
* run `dataset.__getitem__(item_index)`
* send item to the appropriate batch_worker by item_queue

### **Batch Worker**
* get one item at a time from item_queue and append them into batches, by item batch_idx (and batch_size)
* Once all items of a given batch are received, run collate_fn and send the prepared batch to worker_result_queue

### **New parameters**

The following dataloader input parameters were modified / added:

| name                         | description                                                                                                                                               |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| _num_workers_ (modified)     | number of item workers. Setting it to 0 disables multiprocessing (as today). There is no benefit in increasing it beyond _prefetch_factor_ * _batch_size_ |
|                              |                                                                                                                                                           |
| _prefetch_factor_ (modified) | number of batches simultanously sent for processing <u>by all workers</u> (2 by default)                                                                  |
| _num_workers_batches_ (new)  | number of batch workers (default is _prefetch_factor_). There is no benefit in increasing it beyond _prefetch_factor_                                     |   

## **Metrics **
The suggested flow should require significantly less shared memory, while preserving TPT, using similar configurations. \
To monitor shared memory usage, type in Linux server terminal: \
$ monitor -n0.1 df -h \
and review /dev/shm "used" column.

## **Drawbacks**
* Additional layer of batch_workers is required, somewhat increasing flow complexity.
* The user should consider increaseing _prefetch_factor_, if `collate_fn` is very slow and becomes a bottleneck 
  

## **How we teach this**
* Dataloader documentation updates:
  * Add a new parameter: num_batch_workers
  * Adjust parameter description: prefetch_factor
